# E-Commerce Analysis

## Project Overview
The **E-Commerce Analysis** project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to extract meaningful insights, identify sales trends, and understand customer behavior. The goal is to help businesses improve decision-making, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze sales performance across different categories, regions, and time periods.
- Identify key trends and patterns in customer purchases.
- Perform customer segmentation to understand buying behavior.
- Generate actionable insights to improve business strategies.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **SQL**: Data querying and aggregation.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for visual analysis.

---

## Dataset Description
The project uses a publicly available e-commerce dataset containing the following key columns:


---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Import the e-commerce dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
   - Format date columns and normalize text fields.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze trends in sales, profit, and quantities.
   - Understand regional and category-wise performance.
   - Identify the most profitable products and customers.
4. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Use RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Develop visualizations to present insights (bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps).
   - Build interactive dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).
6. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Provide actionable strategies to optimize sales and operations.

## Key Insights
- Top-selling products and categories contributing to revenue.
- Regions with the highest and lowest sales performance.
- Customer segments with high purchase frequency and monetary value.
- Seasonal trends in sales and recommendations for peak seasons.

---

## Dashboard
The project includes an interactive **Power BI/Tableau** dashboard showcasing:
- Sales and profit trends over time.
- Top products and customer segments.
- Regional sales performance.

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ecommerce-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts for data analysis.
4. Open the Power BI/Tableau file to explore the dashboard.
